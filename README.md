# Employee_Attrition
 This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting employee attrition. The model uses employee data to classify whether an employee is likely to leave the company or retain, helping organizations to identify potential attrition risks and take proactive measures.


Key Features
Data Collection: Gather employee data including demographics, job role, tenure, performance, and other relevant features.
Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and encode the data to ensure it is suitable for machine learning models.
Feature Selection: Identify and select the most important features that contribute to employee attrition.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models to classify employees into 'Leave' or 'Retain' categories.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Provide scripts and instructions for deploying the trained model for real-time predictions.
